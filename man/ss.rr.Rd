\description{
Performs Gage R&R analysis for the assessment of the measurement 
system of a process. Related to the Measure phase of the DMAIC
strategy of Six Sigma.
}
\details{
Performs an R&R study for the measured variable, taking into account
  part and appraiser factors. It outputs the sources of Variability, and
  six graphs: bar chart with the sources of Variability, plots by
  appraiser, part and interaction and x-bar and R control charts.
}
\note{
The F test for the main effects in the ANOVA table is usually made 
taken the operator/appraisal
interaction as the error term (repeated measures model), thereby computing F as
$MS_{factor}/MS_{interaction}$, e.g. in appendix A of AIAG MSA manual, 
in Montgomery (2009) and by statistical software such as Minitab.
However, in the example provided in page 127 of the AIAG MSA Manual, the
F test is performed as $MS_{factor}/MS_{equipment}$, i.e., repeatability.
Thus, since version 0.9-3 of the SixSigma package, a new argument
\code{errorTerm} controls which term should be used as error Term, one of 
"interaction", "repeatability". 

Argument \code{alphaLim} is used as upper limit to use the full model, i.e.,
with interaction. Above this value for the interaction effect, the 
ANOVA table without the interaction effect is also obtained, and the variance
components are computed pooling the interaction term with the repeatibility.
